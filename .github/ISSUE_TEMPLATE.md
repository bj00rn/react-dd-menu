<!--
NOTE: I am no longer actively developing this project since it has met most of the initial goals
and I will be spending most of my time developing the bigger project: react-md (https://react-md.mlaursen.com).
I am more than happy to keep review/accepting pull requests with new features/bugfixes but I will not be doing
any of the features or bugfixes myself.
